# Student Hub


### What is Student Hub?
It is a platform for new university studnet to get information from mentors to prepare better for their university. They are able to choose the topic they are interested in and chat with available mentor who is familiar with the topic.

### Why we need Student Hub
During Oweek in university, the stall provided information about uni is always very busy which cause each student only have very few time to consult. 
Also, since many student and mentor live far away from uni which make them unable to attend Oweek or only attend for limited time.  
Furthermore, many stduents complained that Oweek is too late to get these information. 
***Student Hub*** can solve all of these problems. It provide remote match/chat platform for student and mentor which enable them talk at **anytime and anywhere**.
